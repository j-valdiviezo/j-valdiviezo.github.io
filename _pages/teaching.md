*"Jesus is amazing in teaching the course, to cover from the basic theories to the application."* - Student's evaluation (Spring 2020)



My teaching interests span all subdisciplines of chemistry, modern physics, and core concepts of biology and biochemistry. While I can teach a broad range of introductory science courses at the undergraduate level, I feel I could teach advanced chemistry and solar technologies courses with a high level of expertise.
