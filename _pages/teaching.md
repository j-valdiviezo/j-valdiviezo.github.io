*"Jesus is amazing in teaching the course, to cover from the basic theories to the application."* â€“ Student's evaluation (Spring 2020)


Sharing knowledge with others is one of my biggest passions in life. Studies also suggest that teaching can make you a better researcher (Science 333.6045 (2011): 1037-1039). Indeed, various great ideas have come from my teaching experiences. A quote attributed to Albert Einstein captures well how important teaching is for scientists: *"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."* 

I hold a Certificate in College Teaching from Duke University and I have been supported by instructional fellowships such as the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Fellowship.

My teaching interests span all subdisciplines of chemistry, modern physics, and core concepts of biology and biochemistry. I can teach a broad range of introductory science courses, physical chemistry, energy materials and applied machine learning courses with a high level of expertise.
