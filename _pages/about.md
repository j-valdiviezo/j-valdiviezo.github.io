Welcome! I am a Fulbright Alumnus and a PhD candidate in the Department of Chemistry and a Master's student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University. I graduated cum laude with a B.S. in Chemistry from Tecnologico de Monterrey.

I'm also a co-founder of E-Sentience LLC, a startup that uses AI to develop microfluidic devices for sensing. 

Please feel free to reach out if you have questions about my work & experience.
