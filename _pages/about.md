Welcome! I'm a Fulbright alumnuns and an incoming postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley. I come from Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. I did my PhD in Chemistry and M.S. in ECE at Duke University. I graduated cum laude with a B.S. in Chemistry from Tecnologico de Monterrey.

I'm co-founder of E-Sentience LLC, a startup that uses AI to develop microfluidic devices for sensing. 

Please feel free to reach out if you have questions about my work & experience.
