Welcome! I'm a Fulbright alumnuns and an incoming postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley. I come from Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. I did my PhD in Chemistry and M.S. in ECE at Duke University. I graduated cum laude with a B.S. in Chemistry from Tecnologico de Monterrey.

I'm co-founder of E-Sentience LLC, a startup that uses AI to develop microfluidic devices for sensing. 

I'm interested in accelerating progress in Natural Sciences with Machine Learning by developing materials discovery platforms, optimizing materials synthesis, and performing accurate large-scale simulations of chemical processes to address the current global environmental and health challenges.

Please feel free to reach out if you have questions about my work & experience.
